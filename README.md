### Project 4: BetterRest
BetterRest is designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:
- When do they want to wake up?
- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

We then use **CoreML** to get a result telling us when they need to go to bed. Using a technique called Regression Analysis we can ask the computer to come up with an algorithm able to represent all our data.
