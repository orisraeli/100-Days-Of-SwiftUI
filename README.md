# My Solutions for
# 100 Days of SwiftUI
## Course by: Paul Hudson

### Project 1: WeSplit
A check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave.

### Challenge 1: Unit Convert
An app to handle temperature units conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. The user can select input and output temperature unit and see the conversion result.

### Project 2: Guess The Flag
A trivia game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.

### Project 3: View And Modifiers
Technique project, focusing on two fundamental components of SwiftUI: views and modifiers.

### Challenge 2: Rock Paper Scissors
Brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

### Project 4: Better Rest
BetterRest is designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:

- When do they want to wake up?
- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

We then use Core ML to get a result telling us when they need to go to bed. Using a technique called Regression Analysis we can ask the computer to come up with an algorithm able to represent all our data.

### Project 5: Word Scramble
The game shows players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it.

For example, if the starter word is “alarming” you might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

### Project 6: Animations
In this technique project we look at a range of animations and transitions with SwiftUI.
